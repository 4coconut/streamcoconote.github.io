    <h2 class="title">STREAM ANALYSIS</h2> 
    <div class="streama">
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; color: white;">Brief Summary of our Live Stream</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; color: #2d3131;">Coconote’s first ever stream was launched on February 8, 2023. It was a Q&A type of livestream where the streamers talked about the different factors of people’s different music tastes and engaged with the viewers to ask questions to the streamers which were to be answered as well about their topic with 2 halves. It had an average of 93 impressions with 157 views in total with 15 peak views, 5 returning viewers followed by 22 unique viewers. There were some errors during the 2nd intermission where the viewers could hear the streamers prepare for the second part of the Q&A session but later fixed upon notice. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4 style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; color: white;">What is well done in our stream ?</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; color: #2d3131;">In Coconote’s very first stream, The streamers were able to do it with minimal to zero technical difficulties. They were also able to interact well with the audience, and answer their questions. The audience was kept entertained throughout the second half, while their questions were being answered by the members. In the survey conducted on the viewers, 60% of our respondents think that the streamers’ ability to engage with the viewers in their content is excellent. The streamers were also able to properly address the topic and share relevant knowledge about music preferences. From the Streaming Evaluation Feedback form responses, all of the answers are mostly positive. In a question about the streamer’s knowledge about the topic, 73.3% think the streamers’ knowledge is excellent,  20% say it’s good while 7.7% think it's fair.</p>
   <br>
        <h5 style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; color: white;">Areas of opportunities</h5>
    <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; color: #2d3131;">Coconote’s streamers have room for improvement from their very first stream which is affirmed for reviewing the recorded live-stream. The areas of opportunities that have been determined for the streamers’ improvements that are fixed on the streaming feedback evaluation form. Based on the respondents, the following feedbacks needed to improve on are;
        <br> <br> Having the streamers’ camera always open<br> 
        <br>  Sounding more lively<br> 
        <br> Observe professionalism<br> 
        <br> Communicating more with each other and viewers<br> 
        <br>  Streamers have already given the feedback more thought and gained more knowledge in streaming over time. "Having the streamers' camera always open" is very undefinable and cannot be fixed immediately due to a slow internet connection. However, it is possible that it can be fixed by only having a low usage rate of devices that are connected to Wi-Fi that consume too much data. “Sounding more lively” and “Observing Professionalism” is a straightforward feedback on the streamers’ communication and language. The streamers will be practicing and better prepare next time to not be too nervous and speak with more confidence and professionalism, and to entertain the viewers and avoid improper language. “Communicating more with each other and viewers” is another challenge that the streamers’ face because some of them are not used to being broadcasted live but with a little confidence, things would go smoothly in the future.
       <br>For the overall streaming session, 66.7% of the audience think that it’s excellent while 33.3% say we did a very good job. 
    <br>The stream lasted for a good amount of time, and within the hour, the streamers were able to discuss our topic well with the audience while helping the viewers gain a new perspective and better understanding about the different music preferences. With regards to the length of the stream, 66.7% rated it excellent, while 33.3% rated it good.
        </p>
    <br>
    <h6 style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; color: white;">Level of engagement</h6>

        </p>
    <br>
    <h7 style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large; color: white;">What could’ve been the reason why our stream has a high/low viewership?</h7>
    <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif; color: #2d3131;">One of the reasons why the stream has a low viewership was because of the lack of promotion. If the streamers had chosen to promote the stream more, the stream would have reached their expected number of viewers. Using different platforms to encourage other people to watch their live stream will make it easier and more possible for them to reach their goal of higher viewership. 

        Additionally, according to YouTube analytics, only 5 of the 94 impressions viewed the stream. Meaning that not everyone who found the stream watched it. The promotional Facebook post reached 188 users, received 57 likes, and 57 post clicks. Out of the 57 post clicks, only 16 clicked the link to the livestream. </p>
